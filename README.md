# DiffusionVision

DiffusionVision is a project that combines the power of Stable Diffusion models for image generation with object detection using YOLOv5. This project allows users to generate images based on text prompts using the Stable Diffusion model and then apply object detection to the generated images using YOLOv5.

## Features

- Generate images based on text prompts using Stable Diffusion models.
- Apply object detection to the generated images using YOLOv5.
- View both the generated and filtered images side by side in a user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Required Libraries

Install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal:
